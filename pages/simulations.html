            <h1> Chapter Hilights</h1>
            <p class="a">Our SkillsUSA chapter holds meetings at least once a month, 
                and this time was no different. During our most recent meeting, we discussed important state competition 
                information and made sure e
                veryone is aware of the upcoming schedule. Just a reminder, we’ll be leaving for the state competition on April 24th after 2nd period, 
                so please make sure you're packed, prepared, and ready to go!<br>

                In addition to competition prep, we’re also stay
                ing active in the community. We planned a meaningful volunteering 
                event at a local elderly center, where we’ll have the chance to give back, spend time with residents, and represent Skil
                lsUSA with pride. It’s a great opportunity to make a difference and strengthen our leadership and service skills.
